        <hr>
        <p><b><tt>COVID-19</b>, or coronavirus, is a virus that originated in China at the end of December <i>2019</i>. It is a variant of the <b>SARS</b> disease. It spreads through the air, and can be deadly depending on what type you have caught.
The reason this disease is so deadly is because it can <u>stop your breathing</u>. The disease affects you in your lungs.Symptoms include dry cough, fever, loss of taste, and vomiting. It originated around the same time that the Spanish people came to America. Many people died, not just in combat, but also of the disease. The next time it was seen was in <i>2010</i>, with the <b>SARS pandemic</b>, which killed many people. Then, in China, through animal mistreatment, and that caused the first death. Then, schools shut down. Around March <i>12<sup>th</sup>, 2020</i>, The World Health Organization and the Center of Disease Control had named the virus a <i><b>public health emergency</b></i>. People had to seperate, follow guidelines. Then, many variants came along, such as the <b>Delta</b> variant and the <b>Omicron</b> variant. They were so hard to treat, because there wasn't a cure. But then, a <b>vaccine</b> came along, which pretty much slowed the spread after some time. Many things during the pandemic were hard to find, due to many people trying to stock up on food, so they didn't have to go back again, to risk getting covid. That's when everything started going online. People would go to school online, people would buy things online, and a lot of people would stay at home, and would not be able to see their friends in person, making it hard for a lot of kids.<strong> All in all, Covid-19 changed the lives of almost everyone, whether in a good way or a bad way.</strong></tt>  </p> <br> <br>
